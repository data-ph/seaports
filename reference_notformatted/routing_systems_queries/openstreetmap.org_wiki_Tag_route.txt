operator	operator	Name of the company that operates the route.
name	individual name	The name of the route or line.
ref	reference	The reference number/code of a ferry route.
duration	duration	highly recommended for indicating how long the route takes ('00:05' is 5 minutes, '1:15' an hour fifteen, or '48:00' two days). Important to avoid large detours to avoid ferries for routers that underestimate the speed of ferries. OSRM and GraphHopper support this tag (on ways). Use HH:MM:SS, H:MM:SS, HH:MM, H:MM, MM, or M format.
interval	service interval	recommended for indicating how often services run on the ferry route. Use HH:MM:SS, H:MM:SS, HH:MM, H:MM, MM, or M format. Example: A ferry that runs every half hour is given the tag interval=00:30 (interval=30 or interval=00:30:00 are also valid).
fee/toll	yes / no	if you have to pay to cross. Both keys are of very similar popularity, about 500 uses as of 2019[1], see https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2019-June/thread.html#46121 for discussion which tag is preferable
opening_hours	opening_hours	when can you expect the service to be active? (only if the ferry operates on a regular schedule)
reservation	yes / no / only	yes: reservation / booking possible to avoid long waiting times and/or ensure service will run, no: first come, first serve, only: no passage without a reservation / booking.
ferry	*	for the type of road the ferry route belongs to (used with the same values as highway=*).
ferry:cable	yes	Reaction ferry
maxweight	*	Maximum weight of a vehicule.
maxlength	*	Maximum length of a vehicule.
maxwidth	*	Maximum width of a vehicule.
