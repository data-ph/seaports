<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="LOCODE">1.2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1"> 
Column&nbsp;"LOCODE"</span></a></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The two first digits in "LOCODE" column 
indicates the country in which the place is located.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>          
      The values used concur with the &nbsp;ISO 3166 
alpha-2 Country Code. You can also review a <a target="new" href="http://live.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location.html">complete list of countries and their code value</a>. In 
cases where no ISO 3166 country code element is available, e.g. installations in 
international waters or international cooperation zones, the code element "XZ", 
available for user assignment in accordance with clause 8.1.3 of ISO 
3166-1/1997, will be used.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the next part of the "LOCODE" column 
you can find a 3-character code for the location.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 3-character
code element for the location will normally comprise three letters.
However, where all permutations available for a country have been exhausted, the
numerals 2-9 may also be used.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thus, a complete UN/LOCODE is a 
combination of a 2-character country code and a 3-character location code, e.g. 
  <strong>BEANR</strong> is known as the city of Antwerp (<strong>ANR</strong>) which is located in Belgium (<strong>BE</strong>). 
For ease of reading, the country and location code elements are usually 
separated by a space. In actual use, this space could be suppressed. 

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Name">1.3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1"> 
Column&nbsp;"Name" </span> 
</a></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> Column&nbsp;"Name" shows the names of the locations which have been
allocated a UN/ LOCODE. Place names are given, whenever possible, in their national
language versions as expressed in the Roman alphabet using the 26 characters of
the character set adopted for international trade data interchange, with
diacritic signs, when practicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">&nbsp; </span>Diacritic signs may be ignored, and should not be converted
into additional characters (e.g., G�teborg may be read as Goteborg, rather than
Goeteborg, Gothenburg, Gotembourg, etc.), in order to facilitate reproduction in
the national language. In countries with more than one national language, place
names may be different in the respective languages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In such cases, more than one name version maybe included, followed by
other versions placed within brackets, e.g.:</p>
Abo   (Turku) <br>
Turku (Abo) <br>
 
 
<p class="MsoNormal">As a service to users, names that have been changed may be
included for reference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
alternative name versions are included as a transitional measure after a name
change; they are followed by an equal sign (=), e.g.:</p>
Peking = Beijing<br>
Leningrad = Saint Petersburg<br><br>
<p class="MsoNormal">The code element will be shown<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">&nbsp;</span>only under the new name.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In some cases national location names are represented
differently in different languages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
may lead to misunderstandings which can cause disputes in interpretation of
transport and other contracts, in documentary credits, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For any such differing but widely used<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>name forms that are known to or reported to the UN Secretariat,
reference to the preferred name version may be made, followed by an equal (=)
sign, e.g.:</p>Flushing = 
  Vlissingen<br>
Munich = M�nchen<br>
<p class="MsoNormal">A place name may be followed, after a comma sign, by an
indication of geographical or administrative significance, such as the name of
an island on which the place is located, e.g. Bandung, Java; Taramajima,
Okinawa.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There may be subordinate entities under a place name, e.g.
different airports serving the same main location, outlying ports, freight
terminals, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If a separate code
element has been assigned to such a location, the name of the sublocation is
added after the main name, separated by a hyphen (-), e.g.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">GB LHR London-Heathrow Apt</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CL ULC Santiago-Los Cerrillos Apt</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The sublocation name is also listed in its proper
alphabetic name order place, followed by an oblique stroke (slash) (/) and the
name of the main place to which it belongs, e.g.:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">GB LHR Heathrow Apt/London</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CL ULC Los Cerrillos Apt/Santiago</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Abbreviations used in Column 4 include:</p>
